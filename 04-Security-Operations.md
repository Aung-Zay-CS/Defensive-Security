# Security Operation Center
"SOC" stands for Security Operations Center. It's a centralized unit within an organization, typically responsible for monitoring and analyzing security threats and incidents on an ongoing basis. The main purpose of a SOC is to detect, analyze, respond to, and prevent cybersecurity incidents.
SOC teams may use various tools and technologies such as SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems, intrusion detection systems, and threat intelligence feeds to monitor and manage security across an organization's networks, systems, and applications.

##  Purpose of SOC
- Continuous Monitoring: SOC teams continuously monitor the organization's networks, systems, and applications for signs of suspicious activity or security breaches. This proactive monitoring helps to detect and respond to threats in real-time.
- Threat Detection and Analysis: SOC analysts use various tools and techniques to detect potential security incidents, including intrusion detection systems, SIEM solutions, and threat intelligence feeds. They analyze these alerts to determine the severity and scope of the threat.
- Incident Response: When a security incident occurs, the SOC is responsible for coordinating the response efforts. This may involve containing the threat, mitigating its impact, and restoring affected systems to a secure state. Incident response procedures are often defined in advance to ensure a rapid and effective response.
- Forensic Investigation: After a security incident has been contained, SOC analysts may conduct forensic investigations to understand how the breach occurred, identify the perpetrators, and prevent similar incidents in the future. This may involve analyzing logs, conducting memory forensics, and examining network traffic.
- Vulnerability Management: SOC teams also play a role in identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in the organization's systems and applications. This includes scanning for known vulnerabilities, patch management, and implementing security best practices to reduce the attack surface.
- Threat Intelligence: SOC analysts monitor external sources of threat intelligence to stay informed about emerging cyber threats, attack techniques, and malicious actors. This information helps to enhance the organization's security posture and improve threat detection capabilities.

##  SIEM in SOC
SIEM stands for Security Information and Event Management. It's a technology solution that provides centralized log management, real-time event correlation, and comprehensive security monitoring capabilities for an organization's IT infrastructure.
SIEM systems collect, aggregate, and analyze security event data from various sources, including network devices, servers, endpoints, applications, and security appliances.

- Log Collection: SIEM platforms collect log data from diverse sources across the organization's IT environment, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), antivirus solutions, servers, workstations, and other network devices.
- Normalization and Parsing: SIEM systems normalize and parse log data from different sources into a common format for analysis. This process involves extracting relevant information from logs, standardizing data fields, and enriching log entries with additional context.
- Correlation and Analysis: SIEM solutions correlate and analyze security events in real-time to identify patterns, anomalies, and potential security incidents. They use predefined correlation rules, threat intelligence feeds, and behavioral analysis techniques to detect suspicious activities and threats.
- Alerting and Notification: SIEM platforms generate alerts and notifications for security events that match predefined criteria or detection rules. Alerts are prioritized based on severity levels and can be sent to SOC analysts or other stakeholders via email, SMS, or integration with incident response tools.
- Dashboards and Reporting: SIEM systems provide dashboards and reporting capabilities to visualize security event data, trends, and metrics. SOC analysts can use custom dashboards and reports to gain insights into the organization's security posture, compliance status, and threat landscape.
- Incident Response Orchestration: Some SIEM platforms offer incident response orchestration capabilities to automate response actions and workflows. Integration with security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) platforms enables SOC teams to streamline incident response processes and execute automated response actions.
- Compliance and Audit Support: SIEM solutions help organizations meet regulatory compliance requirements and facilitate audit processes by providing centralized log management, reporting, and evidence collection capabilities.

##  Logs in SIEM
Logs, refer to records of events or activities generated by software applications, operating systems, network devices, and other IT systems.
These records contain valuable information about system behavior, user actions, security events, and performance metrics.
Logging is a fundamental component of IT systems for monitoring, troubleshooting, auditing, and security purposes.

- Event Recording: Logs record various types of events or actions that occur within an IT system. This includes login attempts, file accesses, system startups/shutdowns, configuration changes, network connections, error messages, security alerts, and more.
- Timestamp: Each log entry is typically associated with a timestamp indicating when the event occurred. Timestamps help in chronological ordering of events and are essential for investigating incidents and correlating activities across different systems.
- Event Details: Log entries contain specific details or attributes related to the event, such as the source IP address, username, application name, error code, severity level, and other relevant information. These details provide context and aid in understanding the nature and impact of the event.
- Log Formats: Logs can be generated in various formats, including plain text, structured formats (e.g., JSON, XML), or proprietary formats specific to certain applications or systems. Different log formats offer different levels of readability, searchability, and processing capabilities.
- Log Management: Organizations often use log management systems or SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solutions to centralize, collect, store, and analyze logs from multiple sources. Log management tools provide features for log aggregation, retention, searching, alerting, and reporting.
- Security Logging: Security logs, in particular, are crucial for monitoring and detecting security incidents, such as unauthorized access attempts, malware infections, data breaches, and policy violations. Security logs help security teams identify suspicious activities, investigate incidents, and respond to threats effectively.
- Compliance and Auditing: Logs play a vital role in meeting regulatory compliance requirements and facilitating audit processes. Many regulations and standards mandate the collection and retention of logs for security monitoring, incident response, and compliance reporting purposes.

##  SOC workflow
SOC procedures typically follow a set of structured workflows to ensure efficient and effective handling of security incidents and tasks.
