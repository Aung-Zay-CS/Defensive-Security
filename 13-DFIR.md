#  Digital Forensics and Incident Response
 DFIR stands for Digital Forensics and Incident Response. This field covers the collection of forensic artifacts from digital devices such as computers, media devices, and smartphones to investigate an incident.
 This field helps Security Professionals identify footprints left by an attacker when a security incident occurs, use them to determine the extent of compromise in an environment, and restore the environment to the state it was before the incident occurred.
