#  Defensive Security

Offensive security focuses on one thing: breaking into systems. Breaking into systems might be achieved through exploiting bugs, abusing insecure setups, and taking advantage of unenforced access control policies, among other things.
Red teams and penetration testers specialize in offensive security.

Defensive security is somewhat the opposite of offensive security, as it is concerned with two main tasks:

Preventing intrusions from occurring
Detecting intrusions when they occur and responding properly
Blue teams are part of the defensive security landscape.

##  Some of the tasks that are related to defensive security include:

User cyber security awareness: Training users about cyber security helps protect against various attacks that target their systems.
Documenting and managing assets: We need to know the types of systems and devices that we have to manage and protect properly.
Updating and patching systems: Ensuring that computers, servers, and network devices are correctly updated and patched against any known vulnerability (weakness).
Setting up preventative security devices: firewall and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) are critical components of preventative security.
Setting up logging and monitoring devices: Without proper logging and monitoring of the network, it won’t be possible to detect malicious activities and intrusions.
There is much more to defensive security, and the list above only covers a few common topics.

##  Two main operations for Defensive Security

- Security Operations Center (SOC), where we cover Threat Intelligence
- Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR), where we also cover Malware Analysis

###  A Security Operations Center
A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a team of cyber security professionals that monitors the network and its systems to detect malicious cyber security events.
Some of the main areas of interest for a SOC are:

- Vulnerabilities: Whenever a system vulnerability (weakness) is discovered, it is essential to fix it by installing a proper update or patch.
- Policy violations: We can think of a security policy as a set of rules required for the protection of the network and systems.
- Unauthorized activity: Consider the case where a user’s login name and password are stolen, and the attacker uses them to log into the network. 
- Network intrusions: No matter how good your security is, there is always a chance for an intrusion. An intrusion can occur when a user clicks on a malicious link or when an attacker exploits a public server.
- Security operations cover various tasks to ensure protection; one such task is threat intelligence.

###  Threat Intelligence
In this context, intelligence refers to information you gather about actual and potential enemies. A threat is any action that can disrupt or adversely affect a system.
Threat intelligence aims to gather information to help the company better prepare against potential adversaries. The purpose would be to achieve a threat-informed defense.
Different companies have different adversaries. Some adversaries might seek to steal customer data from a mobile operator; however, other adversaries are interested in halting the production in a petroleum refinery.
Example adversaries include a nation-state cyber army working for political reasons and a ransomware group acting for financial purposes. Based on the company (target), we can expect adversaries.
