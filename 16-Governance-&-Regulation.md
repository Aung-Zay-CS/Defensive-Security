##  Information Security Governance
Information security governance represents an organisation's established structure, policies, methods, and guidelines designed to guarantee the privacy, reliability, and accessibility of its information assets
Given the escalating complexity of cyber threats, the significance of information security governance is continually growing.
It is essential for risk management, safeguarding confidential data from unauthorised intrusion, and adhering to pertinent regulations.
Information security governance falls under the purview of top-tier management and includes the following processes:

What are the processes of information security governance: 
- Strategy: Developing and implementing a comprehensive information security strategy that aligns with the organisation's overall business objectives.
- Policies and procedures: Preparing policies and procedures that govern the use and protection of information assets.
- Risk management: Conduct risk assessments to identify potential threats to the organisation's information assets and implement risk mitigation measures.
- Performance measurement: Establishing metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the effectiveness of the information security governance program.
- Compliance: Ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and industry best practices.

##  Information Security Regulation
Governance and regulation are closely linked in the information security paradigm but have distinct meanings. Information security regulation refers to legal and regulatory frameworks that govern the use and protection of information assets. 
Regulations are designed to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access, theft, and misuse. Compliance with regulations is typically mandatory and enforced by government agencies or other regulatory bodies.
Examples of information security regulations/standards include the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), and many more.

##  Key Benefits
The following are the benefits of implementing governance and regulation:

- More Robust Security Posture: Implementing a comprehensive security governance program and complying with relevant regulations can help an organisation reduce the risk of security breaches and protect sensitive information from unauthorised access, theft, and misuse.benefits of security governance and regulations
- Increased Stakeholder Confidence: Effective security governance and regulation can enhance stakeholder trust by demonstrating that an organisation takes cyber security seriously and has implemented measures to protect sensitive data.
- Regulatory Compliance: Compliance with relevant regulations, such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS, can help organisations avoid legal and financial penalties and reputational damage resulting from non-compliance.
- Better alignment with business objectives: Security governance frameworks can help organisations align their information security strategies with their overall business objectives and ensure that security measures are cost-effective and contribute to the organisation's success.
- Informed decision-making: Security governance programs can provide decision-makers with the knowledge they need to make sophisticated decisions about information security risks and ensure that security measures are implemented where they are most needed.
- Competitive advantage: Effective security governance and compliance with relevant regulations can provide a competitive advantage by demonstrating an organisation's commitment to protecting sensitive data and enhancing stakeholder trust.

##  Relevant Laws and Regulations
Specific laws and regulations operate the security governance and regulatory ecosystem. They provide a structured framework for establishing minimum compliance standards, promoting accountability and trust, and fostering innovative approaches to safeguarding critical systems and data.
By offering clear and concise rules, they reduce ambiguity and provide a common language for organisations to measure their security posture and ensure regulatory compliance. 

| Law/Regulation | Domain |
|---|---|
| General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) | Data Privacy & Protection |
| Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) | Healthcare |
| Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) | Financial |
| Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) | Financial |


##  ﻿﻿Information Security Frameworks
The information security framework provides a comprehensive set of documents that outline the organisation's approach to information security and governs how security is implemented, managed, and enforced within the organisation.

This mainly includes:
- Policies: A formal statement that outlines an organisation's goals, principles, and guidelines for achieving specific objectives.
- Standards: A document establishing specific requirements or specifications for a particular process, product, or service.
- Guidelines: A document that provides recommendations and best practices (non-mandatory) for achieving specific goals or objectives.
- Procedures: Set of specific steps for undertaking a particular task or process.
- Baselines: A set of minimum security standards or requirements that an organisation or system must meet.

###  Developing Governance Documents
Here are some generalised steps used to develop policies, standards, guidelines, etc.how to develop governance documents
- Identify the scope and purpose:  Determine what the document will cover and why it is needed. For example, a password policy might be required to ensure robust and secure user passwords. In contrast, a baseline might be required to establish a minimum level of security for all systems.
- Research and review: Research relevant laws, regulations, industry standards, and best practices to ensure your document is comprehensive and up-to-date. Review existing policies, procedures, and other documents to avoid duplicating efforts or contradicting existing guidance.
- Draft the document: Develop an outline and start drafting the document, following best practices for writing clear and concise policies, procedures, standards, guidelines, and baselines. Ensure the document is specific, actionable, and aligned with the organisation's goals and values.
- Review and approval: Have the document reviewed by stakeholders, such as subject matter experts, legal and compliance teams, and senior management. Incorporate their feedback and ensure the document aligns with organisational goals and values. Obtain final approval from appropriate stakeholders.
- Implementation and communication: Communicate the document to all relevant employees and stakeholders, and ensure they understand their roles and responsibilities in implementing it. Develop training and awareness programs to ensure the document is understood and followed.
- Review and update: Periodically review and update the document to ensure it remains relevant and practical. Monitor compliance and adjust the document based on feedback and changes in the threat landscape or regulatory environment.


###  Preparing a Password Policy
- Define password requirements: Minimum length, complexity, and expiration.
- Define password usage guidelines: Specify how passwords should be used, such as requiring unique passwords for each account, prohibiting the sharing of passwords, and prohibiting default passwords.
- Define password storage and transmission guidelines: Using encryption for password storage and requiring secure connections for password transmission.
- Define password change and reset guidelines: How often passwords should be changed etc.
- Communicate the policy: Communicate the password policy to all relevant employees and stakeholders, and ensure that they understand the requirements and guidelines. Develop training and awareness programs to ensure that employees follow the policy.
- Monitor compliance: Monitor compliance with the password policy and adjust the policy as needed based on feedback and changes in the threat landscape or regulatory environment.

###  Making an Incident Response Procedure
- Define incident types: Unauthorised access, malware infections, or data breaches.
- Define incident response roles and responsibilities: Identify the stakeholders,  such as incident response team members, IT personnel, legal and compliance teams, and senior management.
- Detailed Steps: Develop step-by-step procedures for responding to each type of incident,  including initial response steps, such as containing the incident and preserving evidence; analysis and investigation steps, such as identifying the root cause and assessing the impact; response and recovery steps, such as mitigating the incident, reporting and restoring normal operations.
- Report the incident to management and document the incident response process for future reference.
- Communicate the incident response procedures.
- Review and update the incident response procedures.

##   Governance and Risk Compliance (GRC) framework
It focuses on steering the organisation's overall governance, enterprise risk management, and compliance in an integrated manner. It is a holistic approach to information security that aligns with the organisation's goals and objectives and helps to ensure that the organisation operates within the boundaries of relevant regulations and industry standards. GRC framework has the following three components:

Components of GRC
- Governance Component: Involves guiding an organisation by setting its direction through information security strategy,  which includes policies, standards, baselines, frameworks, etc., along with establishing appropriate monitoring methods to measure its performance and assess the outcomes.
- Risk Management Component: Involves identifying, assessing, and prioritising risks to the organisation and implementing controls and mitigation strategies to manage those risks effectively. This includes monitoring and reporting on risks and continuously evaluating and refining the risk management program to ensure its ongoing effectiveness.
- Compliance Component: Ensuring that the organisation meets its legal, regulatory, and industry obligations and that its activities align with its policies and procedures. This includes developing and implementing compliance programs, conducting regular audits and assessments, and reporting on compliance issues to stakeholders.

##  Information Security Management and Compliance
﻿The strategic planning, execution, and continuous administration of security measures are all part of Information Security (IS) management, which protects information assets from unauthorised access, use, disclosure, interruption, alteration, and destruction.
It involves risk assessment and identification, security controls and procedures development, incident response planning, and security awareness training.
Contrarily, compliance refers to observing information security-related legal, regulatory, contractual, and industry-specific standards. In IS management and compliance, we will go through two key standards.

###  ISO/IEC 27001
ISO 27001 is an internationally recognised standard for requirements to plan, develop, run, and update an organisation's Information Security Management System (ISMS).
It was developed by International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and has the following core components:

- Scope: This specifies the ISMS's boundaries, including the covered assets and processes.
- Information security policy: A high-level document defining an organisation's information security approach.
- Risk assessment: Involves identifying and evaluating the risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the organisation's information.
- Risk treatment: Involves selecting and implementing controls to reduce the identified risks to an acceptable level.
- Statement of Applicability (SoA): This document specifies which controls from the standard are applicable and which are not.
- Internal audit: This involves conducting periodic audits of the ISMS to ensure that it is operating effectively.
- Management review: Review the performance of ISMS at regular intervals.
