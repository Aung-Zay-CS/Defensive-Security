##  Malware
The word malware is derived from the term MALicious softWARE. Therefore, any software that has a malicious purpose can be considered malware. Malware is further classified into different categories based on its behavior.

Malware Analysis is an important skill to have. As a quick overview, Malware Analysis is performed by the following people in the Security Industry:

- Security Operations teams analyze malware to write detections for malicious activity in their networks.
- Incident Response teams analyze malware to determine what damage has been done to an environment to remediate and revert that damage.
- Threat Hunt teams analyze malware to identify IOCs, which they use to hunt for malware in a network.
- Malware Researchers in security product vendor teams analyze malware to add detections for them in their security products.
- Threat Research teams in OS Vendors like Microsoft and Google analyze malware to discover the vulnerabilities exploited and add more security features to the OS/applications.


Please note that malware is like a weapon because it can produce great harm if not handled with care. For this reason, always take the following precautions while analyzing malware:

- Never analyze malware or suspected malware on a machine that does not have the sole purpose of analyzing malware.
- When not analyzing or moving malware samples around to different locations, always keep them in password-protected zip/rar or other archives so that we can avoid accidental detonation.
- Only extract the malware from this password-protected archive inside the isolated environment, and only when analyzing it.
- Create an isolated VM specifically for malware analysis, which has the capability of being reverted to a clean slate once you are done.
- Ensure that all internet connections are closed or at least monitored.
- Once you are done with malware analysis, revert the VM to its clean slate for the next malware analysis session to avoid residue from a previous malware execution corrupting the next one.

##  Techniques of malware analysis
Malware Analysis is like solving a puzzle. Different tools and techniques are used to find the pieces of this puzzle, and joining those pieces gives us the complete picture of what the malware is trying to do.
Most of the time, you will have an executable file (also called a binary or a PE file. PE stands for Portable Executable), a malicious document file, or a Network Packet Capture (Pcap).
The Portable Executable is the most prevalent type of file analyzed while performing Malware Analysis.

These techniques can be grouped into the following two categories:

- Static Analysis
- Dynamic Analysis

###  Static Analysis
When malware is analyzed without being executed, it is called Static Analysis. In this case, the different properties of the PE file are analyzed without running it.
Similarly, in the case of a malicious document, exploring the document's properties without analyzing it will be considered Static Analysis.
Examples of static analysis include checking for strings in malware, checking the PE header for information related to different sections, or looking at the code using a disassemble. 

###  Dynamic Analysis
Malware faces a dilemma. It has to execute to fulfil its purpose, and no matter how much obfuscation is added to the code, it becomes an easy target for detection once it runs.
Static analysis might provide us with crucial information regarding malware, but sometimes that is not enough. We might need to run the malware in a controlled environment to observe what it does in these cases.
Malware can often hide its properties to thwart Static Analysis. However, in most of those cases, Dynamic Analysis can prove fruitful.
Dynamic analysis techniques include running the malware in a VM, either in a manual fashion with tools installed to monitor the malware's activity or in the form of sandboxes that perform this task automatically. 

###  Advanced Malware Analysis
Advanced malware analysis techniques are used to analyze malware that evades basic static and dynamic analysis. For performing advanced malware analysis, disassemblers and debuggers are used.
Disassemblers convert the malware's code from binary to assembly so that an analyst can look at the instructions of the malware statically. Debuggers attach to a program and allow the analyst to monitor the instructions in malware while it is running.
A debugger allows the analyst to stop and run the malware at different points to identify interesting pieces of information while also providing an overview of the memory and CPU of the system.
